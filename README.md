## Introduction

This repository demonstrates how to use data schemas to generalize your machine learning algorithm implementation. By using data schemas, you can avoid hard-coding your implementation to a specific dataset, which can make it easier to apply your algorithms to new datasets in the future.

We use the binary classification problem for the repo. The example schema file is created as per Ready Tensor specifications for the Binary Classification problem category.

## Repository Contents

The `app/` folder in the repository contains the following:

- `inputs/`: a folder containing an example schema file called `employee_attrition_schema.json`.
- `schema_reader.py`: a module containing the **BinaryClassificationSchemaReader** class, which can be used to parse a data schema and extract relevant information from it.
- `run_script.py`: an example script that uses the **BinaryClassificationSchemaReader** class to parse an example schema file and print out information about the fields and features in the schema.

## Example Schema File

An example schema file called `employee_attrition_schema.json` is included in the `inputs` folder of this repository. This file serves as an example of the format that a data schema can follow and provides a basis for users to create their own schema files for their own datasets.

## Usage

The repository contains a single Python class, **BinaryClassificationSchemaReader**, which reads a JSON data schema file and extracts information about the features and target variables of a binary classification problem.

To use the **BinaryClassificationSchemaReader** class, instantiate it by passing the file path of the data schema. Then, access the following properties to get the information about the features and target variables:

- `id_field`: the ID field of the data
- `target_field`: the target field of the data
- `target_class`: the target class of the binary classification problem
- `numeric_features`: the list of numerical features in the data
- `categorical_features`: the list of categorical features in the data
- `features`: the list of all features in the data
- `all_fields`: the list of all fields in the data, including the ID and target fields

For more details, see the code and the provided example in the `read_schema` function in `run_script.py` file. To run the code, simply update the path of the schema file in read_schema function and run the script.

```bash
python app/schema_reader.py
```

The function will print the contents of the schema file, including the `id_field`, `target_field`, `target_class`, `numeric_features`, `categorical_features`, and `all_fields`.

## Requirements

The code requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

```makefile
json==2.0.9
```

These packages can be installed by running the following command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
